<h3>Variables:</h3>
-ES6 => let & const(let is for variables that you will need to reassign, const is if you never planned to change the variable)
Note: const needs to have a value for initialization, let and var do not

-ES5 => var (you can re-declare var or overwrite it, and var is hoisted)
-Great article explaining the difference and why we no longer use var
